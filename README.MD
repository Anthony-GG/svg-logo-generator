# CWRU Bootcamp Challenge 10 - SVG Logo Generator

## Description
    
### The goal of this project was to create an SVG Logo company that accepts user input using Inquirer and outputs a logo.svg file using FS.
### Behind the scenes, the programming style used in this project was OOP, Object-Oriented Programming meaning that the main index file actually calls to objects for information or methods to go through the process!
### In addition, we used Jest to develop some tests to ensure that the program was created exactly as we expected! Those tests can be found in the tests folder and can be run using "npm test" after running "npm install".
